# MazeAlgo

This is a little application in Java.

You can run it by executing the code in your IDE (I used Eclipse).

This app will solve rectangular mazes:
1) you choose its size
2) you draw / import / generate a maze (with a START and a FINISH boxes)
3) the app will show you the shortest path from START to FINISH
4) you can export the maze (as a texte file)
